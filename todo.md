## TODO:

- implement echocompass as mirror or simmilar (exactly like eco compas functionality but with these changes)
- - custom mirror enchantment: transdimensional (works in nether and end as well)
- - implement range (range enchantment can increase range from 128 to 512 to 1024 to 2048 blocks)
- - netherite mirror - (range is automatically doubled)
- - durability is 3 but can be restored with mending enchantment (requires a lot of xp to repair) (can't break)
- - can be crafted: 
  "AGA",
  "GNG",
  "LGA"
  "G": "minecraft:gold_ingot",
  "A": "ancient_glass",
  "N": "minecraft:nether_star",
  "L": "Blazerod"
- - new dungeon type with custom vaults (contains: ancient glass, basic upgrade templates)



- display a charge/fuel/durrabillity gui component

- bundle hotkey (and inside e inventory openable per intuitive methode like clicking with controll on bundle) - opens bundle menu: all bundles in inventory (max 9 displayed in top row), doublechest like layout with inside items and switch able to other bundles to manage easier

- netherritehopper upgrade to upgrade to selective netherrite hopper: every slot can be toggled to be a filter (with ghosstitem inside)

- new item magnet texture -> like tune fork but mor magnet looking
- - rename magnet to attractor
- - durabillity mechanic - loses durrability when picking up items (can't break) - can be fully recharged when rightcliched on lodestone block

- bundle/quiver gui improvements
- - beter tooltips 
- - plus icon like vanilla - green when same item is already in bundle, yellow when different item is in bundle, no plus icon when full, red when item can be added but not completly



- sledgehammer should be customizable in a gui - toggle radius, break trough entchantments

- building wand - all wand enchantments possible on it - mode togglable via gui  
- building wand - master-builder minimal faster placing

-- whed middleclicked in creative mode, it gives 1024 items instead of max stack size
